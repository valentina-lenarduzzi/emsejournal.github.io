# Description of the special issue

The assessment of software quality is one of the most multifaceted, e.g., structural, product, and quality, and subjective aspects of software engineering, since in many cases, it is substantially based on expert judgment. Such assessments can be performed at almost all the phases of software development – from project inception to maintenance – and at different levels of granularity – from source code to architecture.

However, human judgment is inherently biased by implicit, subjective criteria applied to the evaluation process, and its economical effectiveness is limited compared to automated or semi-automated approaches. To this end, researchers are still looking for new and more effective methods for assessing various qualitative characteristics of software systems and the related processes.

In recent years, we have been observing a rising interest in adopting various approaches to exploiting machine learning and automated decision-making processes in several areas of software engineering. The machine learning models and algorithms help to reduce effort and risk related to human judgment in favor of automated systems, which are able to make informed decisions based on available data and evaluated with objective criteria. Therefore, the adoption of machine learning techniques seems to be one of the most promising ways to improve software quality evaluation.

Conversely, learning capabilities are increasingly embedded within software, including in critical domains such as automotive and health. For this reason, the application of quality assurance techniques is required to ensure the reliable engineering of software systems based on machine learning. As such, the special issue will invite submissions on new and innovative research results and industrial experience papers in the area of machine learning applications for software quality evaluation.
